This project is aimed towards building an interactive app able to provide the depth, range, and dynamic data analyses of fantasy football data courtesy of APIs and data pipelines. 

There are three critical analysis points that drive success in any given fantasy football league. Success in any league depends on successful initial draft day, flexible and predictive waiver wire player transactions throughout the season, and deciding which players to put in the starting lineup each week. 

## Draft Day Versus Waiver Wire

The visualizations above show how far the draft day activity reverberates throughout a season. While points earned from waiver wire players gradually increases throughout the year, and proved to be critical during the heavy bye-week portion of a season, it is still the draft day selections that have the greatest impact. 

## Setting Starting Lineups

While some players are lineup locks every week, the majority of players will have point scoring potential shaped by a wide range of factors. Teammate injuries, opposing team injuries, weather, recent performances, and other factors have a signficant impact on how well a player could perform. Deciding which players to have in the lineup each week can make the difference between a win or loss.
