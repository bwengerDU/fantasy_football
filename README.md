# fantasy_football

This project is a collaboration between Dan and Bryan with the aim of building a dashboard able to provide the depth, range, and dynamic data analyses of fantasy football data courtesy of an API. Years of playing fantasy football has left us having to manually perform critical analysis of players. 

Enough is enough!!! 

Our many years of education, training, and experience have all led to this moment. We are building a series of analyses to extract the data we feel are most important when making personnel decisions and develop a dashboard that allows us to create meaningful visualizations.
